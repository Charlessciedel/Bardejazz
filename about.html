    <h1>About Us</h1>

<div class="aboutus">
    <h2 >History</h2>
    <p>The idea behind the epic space that is Bar de Jazz was Conceived by Monsieur Charlie Schiedel in 1940. The bar was built in its current location in the year after. Its operations were hampered in the years of 1945-1947 due to the second-world war. What marked the toughest time for the bar became its genesis for the rising to its current state.&5 years later the dream could never be more true. </p>

        <h2>The Trumpet</h2>
        <p> Bar de Jazz believes playing the trumpet is such a intangible experience. The player is compelled to start from the beginning and build anew each day... It isnt like building a house, where we resume where we left the previous accomplishments. Each new day we must rebuild the foundation of our musical structure.</p>

          <h2>The truth</h2>
          <p>The sax as a classical example of an ideal jazz instrument has found a home in the worthy hands of the resident saxophonist Karabo Masenyana. The instrument which is widely acclaimed to talk to people, apparently has alot to say here, The home of Jazz. Ladies and Gentlemen we shall be having sax tonight!</p>
