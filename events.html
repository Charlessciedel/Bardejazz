    <h2>The Jacques Festival</h2>
    <p class="float">The Jacques Festival is regarded as one of Europe's most prestigious jazz festivals, bringing a touch of the European scene to the UK and jazzing it up with the country's famed camping culture.

But Jacques' isn't all about jazz, with its lineup spanning the worlds of funk, soul and blues too. 2019's lineup will feature sets from Snarky Puppy, Jamie Cullum and Gladys Knight.

Beyond the music, festival-goers will also have the chance to immerse themselves in the festival's other side, such as its diverse variety of workshops, wellbeing classes, vintage markets, incredible food and drink stalls, and its kids area, perfect for the young Jacques'. </p>

    <h2> Industry Night</h2>
    <p class="float">One hand still poised on the keys of her saxophone, Lisa Rosenkrantz turns her back to the crowd to count off to her band in a near-whisper: “One, two, three, four.” When she turns back, she is cast in a greenish hue from the lighting. She bends her knees, and with her eyes closed begins a soulful melody.

This is "Jazz on Thursday" at The Industry. Rosenkrantz’s band, the Lisa Rose Jazz Quartet, has alternated playing with the Hennessy Brothers Jazz Quartet each week in this intimate bar since the series began in February. The two groups take on recognizable jazz standards with a twist, such as Duke Ellington’s “Caravan.”</p>
